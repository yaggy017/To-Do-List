# To-Do-List
This is a frontend project where I built a simple and interactive To-Do List app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application is lightweight, responsive, and allows users to manage daily tasks directly from the browser.

Project Overview

Add, complete, and delete tasks easily.
Tasks are stored in the browser’s local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
Clean and minimal UI with responsive design.

Tech Stack

HTML – Structure of the app
CSS – Styling and layout
